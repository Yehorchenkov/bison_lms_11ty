                    <p>This module is dealing with the tools on how to minimise habitat
fragmentation due to various factors, such as transportation or land use
changes. Different planning tools aimed at minimising and reducing
habitat fragmentation are described.</p>
<p>The planning tools can be split into four main categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Legal, institutional and financial measures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technical and ecological measures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Managerial and organizational measures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitoring measures</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the rest of the material, we will take a closer look at these
categories and provide necessary context and useful examples for
improved understanding of these tools.</p>

<h2>Legal, institutional and financial measures</h2>
<p>Under the first category belong the planning tools and measures related
to the legal system, institutional arrangements and financial matters.
Below are some examples from practice.</p>
<h2>Roadless and low traffic areas by law</h2>
<p>Compensatory measures may be required in the case of (IUELL ET AL,
2003):</p>
<p>I.  a) International legislation: the EU Birds Directive (1979) and the
EU Habitats Directive (1992).</p>
<p>b) National legislation on compensation.</p>
<p>Underlying principles when compensation is required by international or
national legislation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Species and habitats protected under (inter)national regulations
require stringent constraints within the planning process and it is
usually difficult to justify the social necessity for developments
in protected areas, or areas with protected species.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial compensation or compensation in terms of other values than
the impacted ones (trading-off) should not be permitted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ecological compensation must address physical and functional aspects
of the impact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the Birds and Habitats Directives compensatory measures
should be implemented before the start of the infrastructure
development.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>II. Formal compensation policy: non-legislative regulation, e.g. laid
down in national policy plans.</p>
<p>Where compensation is linked to formal national policy usually less
stringent measures are required:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Economic or social necessity may, in exceptional cases, justify
project development, under the condition that ecological damage is
compensated for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compensation in terms of 'comparable' ecological values as well as
financial compensation are both permitted, though less preferable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compensatory measures do not necessarily have to be implemented
before the project starts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>III. Compensation based on voluntary agreements, implying that it has
neither a legislative nor a policy basis.</p>
<p>Non-legislative policy requires less stringent conditions on the
implementation of the compensation principle. In the assessment process,
socio-economic and nature conservation interests are weighed against
each other.</p>
<p><strong>Codification of the rules by legal documents (e.g. land use plans, the
concept of ecological compensation, legal obligations, special taxes,
allowances...)</strong></p>
<p>Ensuring sufficient ability to pass the transportation network is from
the point of view of achieving migrating capacity only one step. In the
country of central European type with dense settlement structure there
exist a number of other barriers in form of built-up areas, intensive
agricultural areas etc. Areas of species dispersion are therefore in
form of small islands and populations are mutually separated by
landscape which as a whole is not fitting for permanent existence.
Possibilities to connect these populations are still diminishing and
gradually are turning into small corridors. Slovak and Czech legal
system ensures protection of these corridors in form of supra-regional,
regional and local network of territorial system of ecological stability
(HLAVÁČ &amp; ANDĚL, 2001).</p>
<p>When managing the ability to pass across the highways it is important to
include wider territorial relations of the surrounding landscape such as
territorial studies, plans, projects and territorial systems of
ecological stability. These documents are connected to spatial planning
guarantees protection of the elements of the territorial systems of
ecological stability even in the future. It is crucial to include the
knowledge of dispersion of species, their migration requirements, wider
territorial migration context and concrete terrain configuration in the
place of construction (HLAVÁČ &amp; ANDĚL, 2001).</p>
<p>Significant problem with spatial planning is the issue of future use of
plots in the surrounding of constructed passings. In practice it can
occur that in the future the constructions which are limiting or
directly disturbing the functionality of constructed passings are
permitted. Such constructions are causing on the one hand
non-passability of the line barrier and, on the other hand, also are
causing losing the purpose of previously invested money for building a
passing (HLAVÁČ &amp; ANDĚL, 2001).</p>
<p>The connection between ensuring the ability to pass the highways and the
territorial systems of ecological stability and spatial planning can be
summarized in the following principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The ability to pass the line barriers needs to be dealt with in
wider territorial context taking into account the status of the
landscape, extension and migration of species</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the essential background documents when dealing with ability
to pass are the elaborated territorial systems of ecological
stability on all levels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to pass of the highways for freely living species cannot be
limited to crossing of elements of territorial systems of ecological
stability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When designing the passings it is important to also deal with the
issue of surrounding plots which are conditioning the functionality
of the passing. Ensuring protection of these plots can take place
with a number of measures (agreement/contract with owner, announcing
it as an element of territorial system of ecological stability,
regulation of huntsmanship, building ban etc.). Ensuring protection
of these plots cannot be just requested from the investor, but the
initiative should be taken by relevant nature protection body.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technical and ecological measures</h2>
<p>The largest category includes a variety of technical measures and tools
implemented in the countryside and urban areas to mitigate the negative
effects of land use change and transportation. The list of these
measures is extensive, so we provide just a short overview. For more
detailed list and concrete specifications, you can find information in
the list of recommended readings.</p>
<h2>Fauna Passages and other Technical Solution</h2>
<p>Fauna passages and other structures adapted to increase the crossing of
transport infrastructure by animals should never be considered in
isolation. They should be part of a general 'permeability concept' to
maintain connectivity within and between populations of animals. This
concept emphasizes connectivity between habitats at least at a regional
scale and considers not only the transport infrastructure but also the
distribution of habitats and other potential barriers such as built-up
areas. Fauna passages can then be regarded as small but important
elements used to connect habitats by enhancing the movements of animals
across transport infrastructure (IUELL ET AL, 2003).</p>
<p>At a more specific level, a permeability concept can be produced for a
particular road or railway project. All connecting elements, such as
tunnels, viaducts or elevated roads, stream and river crossings,
culverts, and passages designed specially for animals should be
integrated into the permeability concept. Again, the primary objective
must be to maintain the permeability of the transport infrastructure for
wildlife to ensure the connectivity of the habitats at a larger scale
(IUELL ET AL, 2003).</p>
<p>Mitigation measures, in particular fauna passages, are necessary if
transport infrastructure bisects important patches of habitat, creates a
barrier to migration routes and if avoidance by altering the route is
impossible. Fauna passages are necessary for animals where (IUELL ET AL,
2003):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A road or railway line results in significant damage or loss of
special habitats, communities or species.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A road or railway line affects species particularly sensitive to
barriers and traffic mortality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The general permeability of the landscape, i.e. the connectivity
between habitats in the wider countryside, is significantly impaired
by the infrastructure development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fauna passages are considered to be a suitable solution for
mitigating the barrier effect in the specific context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other less costly measures are unlikely to be effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The road or railway line is fenced along its length.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tunnels</h2>
<p>A tunnel may be the best design solution to protect high-value
landscapes. Though construction costs may be high the benefits to the
natural environment will be incalculable (see Chapter 6). The scale of
these benefits is dependent upon the method of tunnel construction.
Bored tunnels allow sites of high nature conservation value to remain
undisturbed and are least damaging environmentally. Cut-and-cover
tunnels may be more appropriate for sites of lower conservation
interest, but where the maintenance of connectivity between habitats is
desirable. Methods of habitat restoration can be employed to provide
safe crossing for a range of wildlife (IUELL ET AL, 2003).</p>
<p>Siting of the tunnel portals, their landscape treatment, the alignment
of the approach road and the design and siting of any ventilation shafts
and control buildings are the major environmental design issues for any
tunnels. They may intrude into habitats and cause disturbance and
pollution locally for sensitive species (IUELL ET AL, 2003).</p>
<p>A cut-and-cover treatment may be a desirable alternative to the open
cutting as it permits the landscape to be restored over the line of the
infrastructure. The landscape elements appropriate to the particular
location should be carefully designed to be carried over the engineering
structure, which must be capable if necessary of supporting large forest
tree species. The reuse of the original soils should be considered if
they can be stripped and stored in such a way as to minimise compaction
and loss of structure (IUELL ET AL, 2003).</p>
<p>The soil profile should be constructed to match the adjoining profile in
order to reproduce the hydrological characteristics as well as the
physical structure and chemical properties of the original substrates.
Where the cut-and-cover tunnel is to be used by a range of fauna, the
natural vegetation type for the species' habitat should be planted over
the tunnel and on the approaches (IUELL ET AL, 2003).</p>
<h2>Use of vegetation</h2>
<p>At the design stage it is important to understand the type of vegetation
and species composition that is appropriate to the setting of the new
transport infrastructure. Integration with the landscape, nature
conservation benefit and passenger interest are key considerations.
Where possible, species included in planting designs should be locally
indigenous (especially in rural areas) and occur naturally on the soil
type adjacent to the route. They should not require irrigation for
successful establishment. Where suitable, natural regeneration should
also be considered as an alternative method for vegetating new
landscapes. Allowing vegetation to regenerate naturally will produce a
habitat most suited to the local surroundings. Some Mediterranean
regions have special legislation to regulate the use of vegetation on
verges. The high number of forest fires that begin beside roads has
obliged highway authorities for example Catalonia in northeastern Spain,
to forbid the use of pyrophytic plants such as rock roses on road
verges. In the same region there is a requirement to prevent continuity
of canopies between trees and shrubs on the verges and the forest trees
on adjacent land (IUELL ET AL, 2003).</p>
<h2>Cuttings and embankments</h2>
<p>Embankments are suited more to wide, shallow valleys as they (IUELL ET
AL, 2003):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can maintain some degree of connectivity through the use of
appropriately sited and dimensioned culverts and underpasses. In
other situations, lower alignment may allow the construction of an
overpass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can be integrated with the adjacent landform by good use of
earthworks and planting; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offer more scope for screen planting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Where lateral views of the infrastructure are intrusive, a cutting is
one of the best means of hiding it. However, cuttings may themselves
become intrusive, fragmenting habitats, creating a notch in the skyline
or taking the edge of one side of a hill leaving an ugly scar. A curved
alignment over high ground and the careful siting of bridges can help
reduce the impacts of a cutting on the skyline. Bridges can be adapted
to provide a green connection for fauna and flora (IUELL ET AL, 2003).</p>
<p>Cuttings are usually constructed to a uniform gradient of 1:2 and
contrast with natural gradients which are more varied and irregular.
Good design can provide better integration with natural landforms and
provide opportunities for a variety of habitats to be created (IUELL ET
AL, 2003).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Different rock types give rise to different natural slopes and
cuttings should reflect these where possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minor cutting faces especially in upland areas can produce rock
exposures with potential nature conservation value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is desirable to reveal the natural bedding plane of the rock to
provide a stable slope that will not require for reasons of safety
the use of catch fences, wire mesh or other unnatural engineering
elements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In areas of woodland and rough pasture, an irregular cutting surface
finish will provide better integration with the adjacent areas. They
can provide niche habitats for certain plants and invertebrates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are benefits in rounding off the tops of cuttings to a gentle
profile to create a smooth transition to the natural landform.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Crossing valleys</h2>
<p>Infrastructure can be carried across valleys on embankments or viaducts.
Viaducts have environmental advantages subject to the choice of the
appropriate crossing point.</p>
<p>Viaducts are suited to narrow, steep-sided valleys as they (IUELL ET AL,
2003):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Minimise landtake and fragmentation within a valley by allowing
watercourses and any existing nature conservation interest to
continue under the structure;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintain connectivity for species movement; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retain views up and down the valley.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fencing</h2>
<p>The main reason for fencing along the highway is to limit the contact
between automobiles and species crossing the highway. It is obvious that
the ideal solution would be sufficient number of passages of all
categories together with full fencing of all segments between these
objects. Practical experience, though, demonstrate difficult
implementation of these theoretical findings. Firstly, it is important
to stress that fencing in order to fulfil its function must be kept in
functional state which turns out to be a difficult requirement. Whenever
the integrity of fencing is destroyed, species can get into the fenced
area and act confused, attempts to flee, hits the fencing and eventually
up on the road hit by passing vehicles. The same issue is with wrongly
finished fencing where species are also frequently entering the fenced
area (HLAVÁČ &amp; ANDĚL, 2001).</p>
<p>Proper positioning of fencing is of crucial importance, too. From the
point of view of limiting the entrance of species into highway space the
fencing should be constructed between maintained grass stripe along the
road and the beginning of line of trees or bushes. Positioning the fence
to the edge of the hillside with surrounding vegetation (often several
tens of meters from the edge of the highway) is inappropriate. In these
places the fencing is very often damaged by boar species, agriculture
machines or humans. Locating fencing in the proximity of the highway
behind the maintained stripe of grass allows the panicking species, e.g.
during agricultural activities, to stop at the vegetation stripe in
front of fencing, evaluate the situation, calm down and leave the
highway space. In case the fencing is located inside the vegetation
stripe, the panicking species from the fields are often looking for
shelter created by surrounding highway vegetation and attempts to get
into the fenced area. In case of boar species such an attempt is
oftentimes successful (HLAVÁČ &amp; ANDĚL, 2001).</p>
<h2>Noise and glass walls</h2>
<p>Noise barriers are constructed close to human settlements to reduce
noise emissions, although in certain situations they are erected to
protect, for example, colonies of breeding birds from disturbance.
However, even if not constructed for wildlife they have to be mentioned
because they can increase habitat fragmentation even more than fences.
In densely built-up areas noise barriers do not usually provide any
problems in this respect. In more natural surroundings they are complete
barriers for all terrestrial animals (IUELL ET AL, 2003).</p>
<p>Noise barriers built of concrete, wood or other material are complete
barriers for animals. In natural environments they must therefore be
combined with fauna passages. This has to be considered also in cases of
low noise screens along railway lines, which may hinder the movement of
small vertebrates like snakes, which without barriers would not have
been greatly affected by the railway line. In combination with passages
noise screens can function as guiding structures. Noise screens are
usually built on a solid concrete base. They thus completely isolate the
road verges from the surrounding habitats. For small animals, especially
invertebrates, they are therefore a more complete barrier than fences.
No experience exists as to the effects on the animal populations or
regarding possible solutions to reduce the barrier effects, such as
small openings at the base of the structures (IUELL ET AL, 2003).</p>
<p>Transparent screens are erected in areas where planners wish the drivers
or passengers to be able to see the surrounding landscape. They entail a
high risk of mostly fatal collisions for birds, which don't recognise
the wall as an obstacle, in particular where natural vegetation can be
seen through the glass or where the glass reflects bushes or trees. It
has been shown that with appropriate markings the number of collisions
can be reduced substantially (IUELL ET AL, 2003).</p>
<h2>Managerial and organizational measures</h2>
<p>The barrier effect of roads for small animals is partly an effect of the
width of the tarmacked surface. The number of vehicles and their speed,
however, also affect the number of animals killed. Different types of
measures can be beneficial for wildlife (IUELL ET AL, 2003):</p>
<p><strong>Reducing the width of the infrastructure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Agricultural and forestry roads which are not tarmacked are more
easily crossed by small animals, e.g. invertebrates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On agricultural roads an alternative to a fully tarmacked road is
the provision of two concrete tractor-strips. The area between the
strips is kept vegetated, thus providing cover for invertebrates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reducing the amount of traffic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Temporary closure of roads is a suitable measure in cases where
animals only cross a road during a limited period. It is
recommended, for example, to protect amphibians on their migration
to spawning grounds (closure during humid nights in spring) or to
allow wild reindeer to move to their wintering grounds undisturbed
(closure of a road during critical periods in winter).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any other common measure to reduce the amount of traffic (one-way
streets, restricted access, etc.) can also be used as a measure to
reduce collisions with wildlife.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reducing the speed of the vehicles</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reducing the width of the road can reduce the speed of the vehicles
and thus reduce the risk of collisions with mammals. This measure is
suitable for rural roads with relatively light traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Temporarily or permanently lowered speed limits at high-risk spots
can contribute to reducing the risk of collisions with mammals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where collisions happen mainly during the night, speed limits at
night might be sufficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speed ramps are recommended on roads with light traffic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Monitoring measures</h2>
<p>After the construction of roads, railways and waterways the application
of monitoring is of crucial importance as it is this mechanism that
allows planners to check the effectiveness of measures which have been
applied in order to reduce the infrastructure's impact on habitat
fragmentation. A well-designed monitoring scheme will help to achieve
several goals (IUELL ET AL, 2003):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To detect failures in the installation, construction or maintenance
of measures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To establish if the mitigation measures fulfil their purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To evaluate if the measures provide long term mitigation for the
species and habitats.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, monitoring will contribute to establishing whether or not
suitable and sufficient mitigation measures have been provided for
during the planning and construction phases of a transport
infrastructure, guaranteeing minimum impact on the fragmentation of
animal populations and habitats (IUELL ET AL, 2003).</p>
<p>The dissemination of the results of the monitoring scheme is also very
important for gaining knowledge on the development of more effective and
less expensive measures. Therefore, important objectives of monitoring
include helping the infrastructure planners to (IUELL ET AL, 2003):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Avoid repeating mistakes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide new information for improving the design of mitigation
measures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify the measures with an optimum relationship between cost and
benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save money for future projects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Monitoring schemes should be an integral part of the routine technical
management that leads to the adaptation and improvement of the design of
measures which avoid or reduce the effects of transport infrastructure
on habitat fragmentation (IUELL ET AL, 2003).</p>
<p>All mitigation measures have to be routinely inspected and maintained to
ensure their long-term functionality. Maintenance considerations,
including cost, have to be considered at the earliest possible stage,
i.e. when a measure is designed. Planning should define the type and
frequency of maintenance procedures and the organisation of and
responsibility for maintenance. In most cases maintenance will be
carried out by road maintenance teams, but giving a mandate to nature
conservation organisations and farmers, etc., has proven to be a good
alternative for certain types of measures. Specific maintenance aspects
are dealt with in the sections on the different measures (IUELL ET AL,
2003).</p>
<p>The maintenance and monitoring of measures are closely linked.
Monitoring procedures are mainly designed to check whether a measure
fulfils its purpose, but at the same time they can identify maintenance
deficits and needs. Monitoring requires clear definition of the
objectives of the measures, and programmes should be planned in parallel
with the design of the measures themselves (IUELL ET AL, 2003).</p>
