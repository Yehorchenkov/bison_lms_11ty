| Acronym | Biodiversity and Infrastructure Synergies and Opportunities for European Transport Networks (BISON) |
| Grant Agreement No: | 101006661 |
| Duration: | 30 months |
| Start date: | 01/01/2021 |
| End date: | 30/06/2023 |
| Partners: | 39 partners from 16 countries |

The BISON project focuses on infrastructure development and preservation of biodiversity, respectively, in order to achieve social and economic well-being. Resulting from this, two issues should be considered:

- Spatial relationships between infrastructure location and protected areas. The majority of the infrastructure development will likely occur within or around preserved areas and ecosystems with a high level of biodiversity. This may undermine past, current and future conservation investments if spatial planning is not carefully applied. Negative consequences could include the shift of species range due to climate change and the movement of key biodiversity areas (under legal protection or not), towards areas that are also considered to meet current infrastructure demands. Predicting these shifts and (re)designing infrastructure to enhance ecosystems’ resilience, in the context of climate change, can be enhanced by applied research to address these key challenges.

- Innovations in project design can provide a safer and more efficient infrastructure network and reduce the negative impacts on biodiversity, particularly away from protected areas. In addition, upgrading or enhancing the efficiency of existing infrastructure (rather than developing new infrastructure) should be explored as a critical solution to mitigate further land-use change and ecosystem fragmentation16. The innovation potential in this sector is aligned with the European ambition of being a leader in creating green jobs.

These two approaches show that the mainstreaming of infrastructure development with biodiversity is not a one-way relationship where infrastructure would put pressure on biodiversity. The intention is for the relationship to be symbiotic whereby biodiversity operates alongside development. For example, roads, railways and other infrastructures depend on soil erosion control, and/or soil and slope stabilisation techniques through the management of vegetation, nailing, drainage and so on, thus affording protection to ecosystems against natural disasters, such as flooding (or even flash floods) and storm surges. Appropriate monitoring and evaluation to understand the services that biodiversity provide to infrastructure would therefore also support the mainstreaming of biodiversity with infrastructure development. Key synergies to be exploited as part of ecosystem-based adaptation and disaster risk reduction for infrastructure sustainability are also critical in the context of climate change, although caution must be exercised during design and implementation, to ensure that there are ample provisions to benefit biodiversity

<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>

The BISON project will meet the above aim through the specific objectives below:

- Identify research and innovation needs for biodiversity mainstreaming in transport infrastructure.
- Detect the methods and materials that can be used by different transport modes to mitigate pressure on biodiversity.
- Make infrastructure more performant and reliable.
- Support European Member States to fulfil their regional and international commitments for sustainable development.
- Develop collaboration among European Member States to become political leaders on jointly addressing biodiversity and infrastructure challenges.
