<h2 id="aim">What the BISON E-Learning Platform is</h2>

The BISON E-learning Platform is an integral part of the dissemination and implementation activities of the [BISON project](https://bison-transport.eu) consortium. The BISON project aims to address a wide range of problems and challenges related to safeguarding and enhancing biodiversity on the European continent and supporting social and economic development through safe, efficient and sustainable transport systems that are accessible and affordable to all citizens. The BISON E-learning Platform aims to support this development by addressing key stakeholders groups identified according to their position in the process of developing, using, and maintaining biodiversity and transport or on their interest on specific issues concerning the harmonization of biodiversity conservation and transport development. It contains data available at European and national levels including research, policies, legislation and different kinds of interactive data and e-learning materials based on deliverables managed by technical work packages.

<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>

The main E-learning platform objectives are listed below:

- Disseminate the BISON project results to a wide range of stakeholders.
- Provide a user-friendly access to relevant information for different stakeholder groups based on their interest.
- Create a knowledge base for the harmonization of transport infrastructure and biodiversity protection based on the Bison project outputs.
- Establish interconnections between the BISON project and other EU funded projects. 

<h2 id="navigation">Navigation</h2>

The main idea on the navigation of the E-learning platform is to provide a user-friendly access to relevant information for different stakeholder and interest groups based on targeted approach. This targeting is achieved by considering two dimensions: the stakeholders' roles in transport infrastructure development and their specific interests related to issues in transport infrastructure development, biodiversity protection, and enhancement. In a visual form such approach can be presented as a matrix with stakeholders' roles on the horizontal axis and their specific interests on the vertical axis.The matrix cells represent a piece of information relevant to specific stakeholder's role and its interest. The matrix is presented below:

Such approach means that one have a clear access to all necessary information as a specific stakeholder on the one hand  (Fig. 2)

and on the other hand one can easily find all relevant information for a specific interest (thematic block) (Fig. 3).

</figure>

Finally user has access to the same piece of information from different perspectives.

Stakeholder group and thematic blocks are presented on the main page of the E-Learning platform. They are accessible from the main menu and the footer as well.

The information that the E-Learning platform provides for different transport modes is represented by a separate block (Fig. 4).

To sum up, the primary objective of the BISON E-learning Platform is not to educate experts in the intricate aspects of biodiversity protection and transport development harmonization. Instead, its aim is to assist relevant stakeholders in navigating through vast amounts of information in a user-friendly online environment. Each stakeholder is guided along a path that presents the most crucial information aligned with their respective positions or interests. Furthermore, the platform offers additional links to original knowledge resources for detailed research purposes.

<h2 id="additional-information">Additional Information</h2>

In addition to BISON project outputs, the E-learning platform provides access to the knowledge and best practices derived in the BISON project in the interaction with the knowledge available as the outputs from other EU funded Interreg and HORIZON projects such as [TRANSGREEN](https://www.interreg-danube.eu/approved-projects/transgreen), [ConnectGREEN](https://www.interreg-danube.eu/approved-projects/connectgreen) and [INSPIRATION](http://www.inspiration-agenda.eu/at-a-glance.html).

Our team are currently working on developing the platform and making sure it meets the high standards for quality and user experience. The platform will be launched approximately after the outputs from the BISON project are finalized. This approximately planned to take place by October 2023. Until then, the platform will continue to expand and update. The platform is aimed to be a sustainable and lively learning space after the end of the project, which will continue to get shaped step by step.
